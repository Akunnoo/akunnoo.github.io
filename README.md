this account was created for future use to publish code that could possibly help people or to have people help me.
This Respitory I created was just to practice for future use for when I want to actually make a personal one.

If I am being honest, I couldn't find the "clone Respitory" button so, I just clicked on the create new Respitory button. I tried adding Github on my macbook but it want allow me to do so. I am doing everything online and just followed the steps given by my instructor.
