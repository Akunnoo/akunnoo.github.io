Create a Github Account: Go to github.com and sign up for an account if you don't already have one.

Create a Repository: After logging in to your Github account, you can create a new repository by clicking on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and selecting "New repository." Follow the prompts to give your repository a name, description, and choose other settings as needed.

Cloning the Repository: To clone the repository onto your local machine, you'll need Git installed. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Use the following command:
git clone <repository_url>


Make Changes: Navigate to the cloned repository directory on your local machine. Make changes to files, add new files, etc.
Commit Changes: After making your changes, stage them for commit using the git add command, and then commit the changes using git commit: git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"

Push Changes to Github: Finally, push your committed changes to Github using the git push command:

git push origin master
This assumes you're pushing to the master branch. If you're working with a different branch, replace master with the appropriate branch name.
Submit Repository URL: After pushing your changes to Github, copy the URL of your repository from the address bar of your browser and submit it to your instructor along with any required screenshots.
